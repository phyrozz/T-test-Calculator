# T-test-Calculator

This is a simple application that let's the user input two sets of data and calculate their t-value.
The program also gives additional data such as the set's mean, standard deviation, and variance.
You can also calculate the r-value for two sets of data, which would then be converted to t-value automatically.

The program has an alpha that is set to 0.05.

## Features to be added:
- Support for one-tailed data
- Support for changing the alpha
- Increase support for higher sets of data (df > 30)
- Support for other tests such as the z-test and ANOVA
- GUI, 'cause console is ugly.
